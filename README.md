# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This was another fun js project to get started with.  This one was good for working with the DOM, adding/removing classes to elements based on choices then showing/hiding areas.  I wasn't too concerned with making it pixel perfect CSS wise, more the js practice.  I'm looking forward to seeing how others added the stars after making the rating selecting - I just stored the rating in a variable and then did a for loop where it added a star img element each time.
